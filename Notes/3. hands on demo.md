1-istio-init.yaml  2-istio-minikube.yaml  3-kiali-secret.yaml  4-application-full-stack.yaml
```

## Getting it running

Install istio via included yaml. 
istioctl is the more common way to do it. These files are just from the class. 

```
k apply -f 1-istio.init.yaml
k apply -f 2-istio-minikube.yaml
```

Used to be a ton of pods, now just some.

* Grafana - series of graphs
* egress/ingress - control in/out of cluster
* jaeger - tracing
* kiali - istio ui
* prometheus - monitoring

Install Kiali secret with 3

## Enable sidecar injection

You could run the deployment yaml through istio and then it adds the sidecars to that. 
* Not a good way, set the flag to do it automatically. 

Tell Istio to inject into an entire NS
```
k label namespace default istio-injection=enabled
```

## Run applications
```k apply -f 4-app...```

## Debug issue
App isn't working. We're not sure why. 
Look at Kiali to see performance issues 
Red lines on graph are showing degraded connections. See traffic metrics.

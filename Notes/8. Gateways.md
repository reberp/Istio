## Ingress Gateways

## Why need one: 
BLUF: To apply custom routing and load balancing to the edge service. 
**Example:** Want to deploy a 10% canary release on the front end webapp. Setting up the old way doesn't weight right. 
**Reason:** Before, we were accessing through another pod, where the sidecar proxy was able to load balance. Here, we're accessing the service directly, which gives regular round robin. Having a proxy on the incoming requests, you can load balance and weight it. An 'Edge Proxy'

## Ingress Gateway
Basically just a pod so that you always request that pod and then your requests are routed through a proxy that acts as an edge proxy. 

Comes by default with istio as a LoadBalancer service. Have to have a gateway configured to listen on a port and then forward traffic. 
Typically just one configured. 

Load balancer is already thinking on 31380 -> 80. 

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: Gateway
metadata:
  name: ingress-gateway-configuration
spec:
  selector:
    istio: ingressgateway # use Istio default gateway implementation
  servers:
  - port:
      number: 80
      name: http
      protocol: HTTP
    hosts:
    - "*"   # Domain name of the external website
```

Setting gateway and then visiting page goes to no service, but is connecting. 

The forwarding isn't configured here, but on the virtual service yaml with the gateways. Since we want everything that calls web app by domain name to be weighted as well as anything that calls the webapp service, have to add another hosts item. 
```
apiVersion: v1
items:
- apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
  kind: VirtualService
  metadata:
    name: fleetman-webapp
    namespace: default
  spec:
    hosts:
    - fleetman-webapp.default.svc.cluster.local
    - "*" #copy value in the gateway hosts
    gateways:
    - ingress-gateway-configuration
    http:
    - route:
      - destination:
          host: fleetman-webapp.default.svc.cluster.local
          subset: original
        weight: 90
      - destination:
          host: fleetman-webapp.default.svc.cluster.local
          subset: experimental
        weight: 10
kind: List
metadata:
  resourceVersion: ""
  selfLink: ""
```

## Prefix Routing

## Subdomain Routing
An alternative to prefix routing in the case (like this one) where prefix doesn't work for the application.

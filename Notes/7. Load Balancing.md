Virtual Services can be updated to have different load balancing options. 
Can the session be set to stick based on which canary they get. 
## Stickiness
Make a user 'stick' to one canary 
Consistent hashing is the only way to do it. 
This was at time of recording, guides online suggest to use consistent hashing with an app provided user id. https://tetratelabs.io/istio-in-practice/sticky-sessions/
Could use an IP address maybe 

### Consistent Hashing
Pick some value and hash it and use that as a way to 'stick' that hash value to one canary. 
It doesn't work if you also want to use weighted routing. https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/9764
* Other option shown in that issue as comments, have one set the cookie and then the others look for it and route
Without weighted routing, works ok if you propagate headers right.

## Canary Release

Doing canaries with fidelity on just K8s is kindof a pain I guess. Could add pods and do round robin load balancing but doesn't work well. Istio makes it easier. 
Want to split the traffic between pods where some are 6-placeholder and others are just 6 with 10% going to the new one.  

### Version Grouping
Versioned app graph makes it obvious what pods are backing the service. 
If the pods are labeled, the label shows up on the graph instead of the name. 

### Staged Releases & Canaries
* Required: VirtualService and DestinationRules
#### The Kiali-auto method
Create weighted routing in the service page on kiali. 
This will make the objects for you. Can export them to YAML.
[DestinationRule](../../CourseFiles/2-Traffic-Starting/kiali-created-dr.yaml)
[VirtualService](../../CourseFiles/2-Traffic-Starting/kiali-created-vs.yaml)

#### The YAML way
Make Destination Rules and YAMLs yourself. 

## Virtual Services
Enables you to configure routing rules to the service mesh. Let you do intelligent routing management, otherwise don't need them. 
Normal services load balance across pods, but they don't actually exist, it's based on the DNS response. 
Virtual services configures the proxy sidecars. Envoy is actually the one implementing that canary functionality. Services are still needed. 
Proxies still need to use DNS through a service to contact. 
[VirtualService](../../CourseFiles/2-Traffic-Starting/istio-vs.yaml) 
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: VirtualService
metadata:
  name: fleetman-staff-service
  namespace: default # typically same NS as target service
spec:
  hosts:
  - fleetman-staff-service # The service that rules are applied to
  http:
  - route:
    - destination:
        host: fleetman-staff-service # route to this service with this weight
        subset: safe # matches name in DR that defined this group in this service   
      weight: 90
    - destination:
        host: fleetman-staff-service
        subset: risky
      weight: 10
```

Kiali can help debug errors with VS or DR files. Typos in services and stuff. 
## Destination Rules
Configuration of a load balancer for a service. 
Subsets are for different balancing. 
The DR defines what the subsets are based on for each service. Required for Istio to match the subsets against specific pods in a service. 

[DestinationRule](../../CourseFiles/2-Traffic-Starting/istio-dr.yaml)
```yaml
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1beta1
kind: DestinationRule # Defining which pods should be part of each VS subset 
metadata:
  name: fleetman-staff-service # anything
  namespace: default
spec:
  host: fleetman-staff-service # what the subsets are pulled from
  subsets:
  - labels: # actually a pod selector 
      version: safe # find pods with this label (in service?) 
    name: safe # name that VS can use to match against 
  - labels:
      version: risky
    name: risky
```

## Cascading Failures
What we want to avoid as an example:
* Pod A has an issue, doesn't matter what. 
* Pod B that requests from it starts to get delayed responses or none
* Eventually, the frontend stops responding

## Circuit Breaker:
https://istio.io/latest/docs/tasks/traffic-management/circuit-breaking/
Add microservice software to monitor pod connections to decide when to stop communicating to other broken service. 
Or better is to add it into a proxy. 
Allows the broken service time to come back, if it will. 
Prevents a flood of requests hanging or loading systems. 
Service needs to be tolerant to getting 5XX that the circuit breaker will return. 

## Outlier Detection

```
apiVersion: networking.istio.io/v1alpha3
kind: DestinationRule
metadata:
  name: circuit-breaker-for-the-entire-default-namespace
spec:
  host: "fleetman-staff-service.default.svc.cluster.local"          # This is the name of the k8s service that we're configuring

  trafficPolicy:
    outlierDetection: # Circuit Breakers HAVE TO BE SWITCHED ON
      maxEjectionPercent: 100     # What percent of the upstream to eject. 
      consecutiveGatewayErrors: 2 # Triggered after 2 5XX in a row
      interval: 10s               # Interval for the two consecutive errors
      baseEjectionTime: 30s       # How long it's triggered for. Grows if it triggers again. 
```
